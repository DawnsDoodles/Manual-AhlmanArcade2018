# Ahlman Arcade 2018 (AP Manual)
Ahlman Arcade 2018 is a collection of games made by the game industry students at Ahlman Institute. Containing 14 short, but diverse games ranging from a wide cast net of genres. 

## What Are You Searching For?
The goal of this manual is to collect 10 Arcade Tokens, using the 14 games (see below) that are in the game to find them. After the tokens are found, the player is expected to finish a game that's selected for them.

## Play Guide
The following is a list of what to expect from each game:

#### Ms. Woman Runner
A two level auto-runner where the player plays as a woman running through a city and then a forest, there's not too many checks in this game given the lack of levels, and its difficulty is about middle of the road, but in a pinch it's not too bad.

#### Going Home
A horror walking simulator that walks you through the last six days of a depressed mans life. The game is a good source of checks, but playing it can be kinda glitchy, and potentially softlock if you're not careful.

#### Dragon's Fodder
One of the hardest games in the collection, with four checks to its name. In this bullet hell, you play as a dragon and traverse through a land full of penguins and crows, you can breathe fire, teleport short distances, and summon a temporary shield to help your journey.

#### Jasan Päiväuni
A hidden slender-like horror game where the player traverses the dark to pick up the five keys and escape the flesh eggs in the area. To get to it, click on the key near the Dragon's Fodder and Going Home machines. Then head back to the main lobby and fall into the basement. It's pretty easy to forget this game exists, but having six checks in this manual does make it a good game to hint in a pinch.

#### Dr. Nestor's Ark
A survival game where the player plays as Dr. Nestor, a man in an apocalyptic world trying to rescue the local wildlife. It can be pretty easy if you know what you're doing, however, it should be said that the game only has one level, and thus means it only has one check.

#### Fox's Berry Adventure
A simple platformer where you play as a fox and collect apples. There's really not a ton to describe in this game, but it should be said that it too, only has a single check behind it.

#### Ballcat's Homerun
A simple four level sidescrolling platformer where you play as Ballcat as he tries to get to home plate. Avoid the catchers mitts!

#### Ungifted Bunny
A simple, single-stage stealth game where you play as a bunny plush that's trying to escape what can only be described as Toy Hell. This game is actually very easy, but it's single check status leaves it low on the priorities list.

#### Deadline
A 2-course racing game. Both levels have their own checks.

#### Shadow Glider
The hardest game in the arcade. It's a bullet hell, and a not particularly fun one at that. It's got 4 checks. Pray nothing important is locked behind there.

#### Corgi Jumper
For 10 checks. You can play this auto-scrolling platformer where you play as a fairy riding a corgi bouncing off of leaves falling from the sky. It can be kinda tricky at times, but having so many checks makes it worth it.

#### Top Hat Cat
Another bullet hell. You play as a mouse trying to collect as many cheeses as you can. Considering the difficulty of this one, the manual maxes out at 3 checks of cheese, as any more than that borders on impossible levels.

#### Mr. Potato Runner
A platformer that could hypothetically go on forever. You play as a potato, collecting other potatoes. There are 10 checks to this game for each 1,000 points gained from collecting potatoes.

#### Disc Golf Experience
It's kinda what the name says on the tin. 9 Holes, 9 Checks, enjoy disc golf.
